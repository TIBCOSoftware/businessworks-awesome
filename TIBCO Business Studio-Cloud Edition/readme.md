When it comes to creating REST APIs, there’s the hard way and the easy way—the easy way is via TIBCO Cloud Integration (TCI).  In fact, one of the main goals in designing TCI was to make the creation, testing, use, and deployment of REST APIs… well, easier.

We at TIBCO set out to prove this and one way to do it was to host an internal company-wide Hackathon—we wanted to see if TCI was really as easy as we claimed it was.  The result was pretty outstanding; we had teams compete from all over the world and across a number of departments. 

It’s incredible what our Hackathon competitors were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time and by such a diverse group of roles and locations. We don't want to keep these amazing submissions for ourselves so we've decided put the sources on GitHub. In this folder you'll find many great connectors to many great SaaS applications to use within TIBCO Cloud Integration. Simply download one of the zipfiles and import them into TIBCO Business Studio - Cloud Edition.
